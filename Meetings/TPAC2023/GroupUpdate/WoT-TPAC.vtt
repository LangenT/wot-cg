00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.023 
Hello, welcome to the introduction video of Web of Things

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:14.427 
Since you came across this video, we assume that you heard a bit about

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:19.830 
the Web of Things and Thing Description. But let us give a brief introduction.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.046 
First, lets talk about what is the difference between IoT and the WoT.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:34.100 
While IoT focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, WoT leverages IoT and aims

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.154 
to provide interoperability between Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:47.109 
So lets talk about a thing and thing description.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.657 
In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:58.205 
IoT device or service. And TD provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:04.141 
WoT provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:10.077 
streamline IoT application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm.

00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:17.755 
With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases, especially

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:25.433 
in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools.

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:32.100 
If you want to learn more, we are developing a tutorial series called “what is WoT?”

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.174 
Throughout this video series, we will explain the Web of Things, its applications and tools for newcomers.

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:45.497 
This is to learn WoT and speed up the learning process.

00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:50.754 
Each video is short, so you can learn WoT bit by bit.

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:55.989 
At any time, you can come back and use the videos as a reference.

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:01.883 
This video series is not only consisting of material to watch, but is also

00:02:01.883 --> 00:02:07.777 
supported with code snippets that you can work on and try by yourself.

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:14.722 
At the end of the series, you will have all the tools in your belt to build WoT applications.

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:20.321 
With all these tools, you can build actual software such as dashboards,

00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:25.082 
protocol proxies and translators,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.397 
smart internet-connected devices,

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:32.470 
mash ups of WoT devices and services,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.515 
in many domains such as Smart Homes,

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.929 
and Factory Automation.

00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:48.199 
What can be achieved with the WoT is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and develop

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:54.864 
the WoT applications If you are ready to dive into world of WoT, let's start this journey!

00:02:54.864 --> 00:03:01.227 
For the rest of the series, make sure to follow the W 3 C WoT Community Group,

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:05.806 
And we have multiple options to stay in touch with Web of Things:

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:08.431 
You can join the Discord server.

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:15.547 
You can find how companies use WoT via the presentations on the YouTube channel.

00:03:15.547 --> 00:03:20.709 
Also you can join one of the office hours happening every Thursday.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.220 
You can visit w3 dot org/wot to learn more about WoT. If

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.731 
you want to contribute you can join WoT community group too.
