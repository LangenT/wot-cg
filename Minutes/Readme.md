# W3C WoT CG Meeting Minutes

This folder contains the minutes taken during the W3C WoT CG meetings.

An initial save of the minutes take place and are committed to save the unedited state.
A single html file is saved from the W3C server without the additional CSS and JS that comes in a folder.
Since we are not planning to host the final versions, it does not make sense to save them in a pleasant-to-look-at version.

A manual or automatic post processing takes place to do the following:

- Removing mention of draft: 

```html
<h1>WoT CG at TPAC 2022</h1>
```

becomes 

```html
