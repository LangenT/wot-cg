## Meetup

### Introduction

CA: Hi everyone. We have an agenda

CA: (intro)

CA: You can join the CG, Discord

CA: Here are the next meetups:

- Meetup 14: with Ben Francis: Webthings.io and Krellian for Smart Buildings
- Meetup 15:  with Timoteus Ruotsalainen. Link and topic to be made public soon. 
- Meetup 16: with Deutsche Telekom: Matter and WoT
- Let us know if you are interested to give a talk!

#### Speaker Introduction

CA: Richard works on microscopy and experimental automation, including the development of a 3D printable translation stage with sub-micron accuracy. He has transferred a number of technologies to commercial partners, and leads the OpenFlexure project. 

CA: He will talk about how he learned about WoT and how he applied it in his use cases.

### Presentation

RB: This is not a toy! It is a serious piece of equipment that is an automated microscope.

RB: You can fit everything together. You can reduce the cost. It is replicable. That means you can improve.

RB: Why do everyone need a microscope? This is the parasite that causes malaria. 500k deaths, mostly children in sub saharan africa.

RB: Quality assurance is a problem, so is training new technicians.

RB: OpenFlexure can help you to produce it locally. Our engineering partners can build it without an error prone supply chain.

RB: Many countries have built it and without much interaction with us.

RB: I do not have to worry about how to sell it to help everyone. 

RB: We have managed to build a community

RB: This is another image from our microscope

RB: This is an illustration of what the community is doing. 

RB: Another interesting part is that someone can send images without sending the samples.

RB: Community in Argentina is using to understand the soil to suggest better farming practices.

RB: The hardware assembly instructions pipeline has become its own open source project. 

RB: Also, an API is available so that you can use interactions and avoid the UI.

RB: here is a UI built with Vue. You can use as an electron app which also does mdns to find the microscope.

RB: We distribute the UI from the microscope so that they are always in sync.

#### LabThings

RB: Now into the sw architecture.

RB: We have different types of users.

RB: We have a RPi based hardware. Also RPi camera. Motors are XXXX.

RB: You can attach a screen via HDMI screen.

RB: A phone would also work but that is problematic. It can be stolen. There are many variations. You cannot leave it around for 3h.

RB: You can pop up the same interface remotely.

RB: Here is a more detailed diagram. An HTTP API is exposed that is WoT compliant.

RB: The server publishes via mDNS so that it is simple to use it. No need guarantee DHCP.

RB: If you know the IP address, you can just use a browser.

RB: You can use the same API via scripting. Python and matlab are both available.

RB: UI and script can run at the same time.

RB: If you do a simple script, it is fine. More complicated cases are much more difficult to do it via script. The HW talks to only one process at the time.

RB: The client code can be moved, there can be many clients.

RB: You can start the script and detach or turn off your computer. That way if your computer reboots, you do not lose your experiment.

RB: Now we have switched to FastAPI. It was flask before but we were in version 1. Instead of updating the version, we have now updated to FastAPI.

RB: At the same time, we have added the WoT integration.

RB: Microscope is now a composed Thing. Each Thing is a Python class.

RB: Signature of the Thing and ThingClient are same thanks to WoT. 

RB: That has been really helpful. We can work in a friendly environment. We can now run the same code in client and server at the same time.

RB: GUI is written in Vue.js but is a bit outdated. We use Axios. We only use HTTP, so no other protocol bindings.

RB: We have some vue components that are used to create an interface.

RB: I had hoped to use node-wot but it doesn't work with webpack? I think one of the dependencies doesn't work with webpack.

RB: We have built it into a liquid handling use case. They all had WoT style interactions. One didn't have WoT interface but at least HTTP.

RB: This also enabled to develop more friendly UIs, like blockly.

### Involvement in WoT

RB: How did we learn about WoT? Thanks to Joel Collins, my post doc at the time. 

RB: It has helped to design our API.

RB: In labs, there is no single OS or programming language that is used.

RB: There is nice promise about semantics.

#### Pain Points

RB: It would be nice to have standardization on long running actions. An event that is associated with the action would be nice. I had to invent a bit of stuff at the same time.

RB: More details on protocol bindings would be nice. Websockets is needed. I did not invest in it since I am hoping the community

RB: An equivalent for TD would be nice.

RB: TD is not JSON Schema, not quite. I spent some time on it. I am not happy with that part of the code.

RB: There are other frameworks but they all have drawbacks... Scientists build these kind of SW and try to be one for all but it doesn't work

RB: Not trying to do everything is nice for WoT.

RB: How to align with taxonomies via semantic types is really needed in the future. With different typing, we can add more types to add more compatbility to different frameworks.

RB: I want to have a way to assert compatibility between two TDs.

### Q&A

FT: Do you have an TD example?

RB: They are always generated on the fly, they are dynamic. I will try to find one now.

CA: We are trying to fix the node-wot problem

RB: Here are TDs. We packaged them into one JSON for convenience.

LB: One question was how to ensure interoperability. There are two routes that are evolving over time. You can add ontologies, you can also create your own ontologies. Profiles can also work so we need more feedback.

LB: You can look into SAREF, which might be good for you. You can also mix and match.

LB: You can also look into Tauri that may avoid electron problems. It can enable users to use a tablet. It sort of plays nice with anything you throw at it. 

RB: Thanks. Electron app doesn't do much.

RB: FastAPI version will be moved to OpenFlexure soon. Also it is less feature rich than node-wot. LabThings Fast API is quite generic.

MW: I am working at Waters Corporation as Chief Architect. I have tried to model a spectrometer in TD. How do you link the different TDs in that big object?

RB: There are generally no links. One example where it happens is the camera autofocus is used together with Z motor. We do this with FastAPI dependency mechanism so they can have access. You do not need to know the other of things to start.

RB: Also scanning depends on the autofocus.

MB: We have non trivial Things, like 30000 properties.

EK: JSON Schema. We want to align and add most of the features.

CA: You can use a TDD.

RB: Yes, it would make sense. I already have a list of TDs.

MW: Splitting TD into small TDs make sense but it can lead to inconsistency. The smallest set we managed to get was 70 Things.

MW: We have also thought of using links to the anchors.

LB: If you expect something to change, you should use properties and not links. TD should be treated as a static resource.

EK: isn't there commercial microscopes that offer the same sw/api benefits?

RB: There is vendor lock in. You cannot control another microscope with that control sw. Sometimes you want to do an experiment that uses multiple microscope manufacturers. There is jlib that is very popular but it is not liked.

RB: Micromanager devs were interested in WoT.

RB: You cannot believe how many researcher months are wasted in getting the dev environment ready.

EK: Is your mdns mechanism also wot compliant?

RB: No. But it would be nice to align with it.

EK: Can you go into details of the extensions you mentioned?

RB: Now they dont exist. Each Thing was an extension.

## :envelope_with_arrow: Feedbacks

- The standard thinks that actions are short running. LabThings needs long running actions.
- The fact that our Data Schema is not aligned with JSON Schema is confusing.
- Websockets binding is needed
