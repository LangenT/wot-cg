## :book: Minutes

### Welcome

ca: (presents the agenda)

ca: (introduces himself)

ek: (introduces himself)

ca: we have different pages for the CG, you can find the links here



### News from the CG

ca: We have next internal meeting on the 3rd of April

ca: if you are an implementation owner, you can ask to have your an implementation channel

ca: we have a growing interest in WoT, worldwide as well

### Empowering Industrial Automation with WoT

ca: (introduces the speaker and SICK AG)

mh: I will talk about our WoT implementation

(shows the agenda)

mh: we have a portfolio of 40000 product with different features

... this way we create different solutions. Our customers are flexible

... the challenge we have faced was integrating devices

... we use these sensors in factories

... the applications are custom

... we have to connect the operational technology to informational technology.

... we need to connect data but also the metadata of the sensors, like manufacturer

... we need the relationships as well

#### Creating TMs

mh: we create TMs via the Editdor project

... the TMs are then stored in a database

... these become our building blocks that can be reused.

... we have a low-code platform that connects to the devices

... the final implementation building block has 

#### SICK ConnectX

mh: we bridge the shopfloor and IT

... support HTTP and MQTT northbound

... southbound protocols as well, such as IOL-JSON

... the devices are configured via our web tool

... we build relationships as well, controller having child sensor things

... we represent them as 

#### Challenges

mh: we faced a challenge that schema.org annotations are not going to be enough

... we will create our own ontology soon

... in the end the edge is connected to the cloud via SICK LiveConnect

... we can also reverse client-server for cloud applications so that we can bypass the firewalls

... it is a secure ws based protocol

... this way we have digital twins of our sensors in the cloud

... we have a tunneling protocol in the end, we support the affordances

... we have two TDDs, local and cloud. The cloud one is a readonly

#### SICK AssetHub

mh: In the end, a company can monitor all their assets as digital twins on the SICK AssetHub

... we can manage any device that has a TD

... we can then build applications on top of everything

... for example, SICK Dashboard App to monitor.

... you can also have AR applications that overlays real dataw

### Q&A Session



ph: I am very impressed. Do you also link handbooks to the TDs?

mh: We do not do it yet. but we want to in the future

ph: The question came up quite a bit recently since we need to differentiate between semantic links and links to documentation.

ph: What do you think of open source? I want to start a community for authoring 

mh: we have started the legal process for that. contribution to node-wot and scripting api is planned



mh: we are 10-20 working on it

m braun: how do you map data to semantically enriched model? In my process automation view, there are devices with conditions. How are they evaluated?

original question: Mapping of data from devices to a semantically enriched model:
Straight forward 1:1 or additional combinations (e.g. expressions) possible

mh: we are letting application engineers do some of these manually. Sometimes the annotations are neough

dp: you are using schema.org . You are facing the issue that some terms are missing. Do you want to contributte to schema.org?

mh: We would like to if possible. We are searching for possibilities to where to do that.

mb: There are other vocabularies out there as well, such as OPCUA with layered vocabularies. 

mh: Is there an overview of these vocabularies?

mb: These are the companion specifications.

lr: Have you developed 3rd party adapters?

mh: we have developed for our proprietary protocol but we will have IO Link soon

sk: congratulations. you have come really far, really nice presentation. W3C and OPC Foundation are going to work together in the new charter. In addition to the OPC UA binding, we will have work on how to use the data models in the companion specifications.

... I will also hold a talk about this in the Hannover Fair.

sk: Do you have TDs available?

mh: You can see them in the asset hub.

sk: let's exchange about this

fp: Are you using open source implementations? Like the TDD?

mh: we contribute to Editdor but there was no suitable TDD implementation when we looked at. So we did ours but we are using node-wot.

fb: How was your experience with searchability in the TDD?

mh: We have a very basic search. The actual search will come later.

ph: Are you using annotations for the specific data types?

mh: yes

mh: the relationships between TDs are based on the network.

... there are new features coming

s. pollmeier: I have pasted a link for submodel templates link from IDTA. They are connected to ECLASS which is connected IEC CDD. Are you looking into such semantics as well?

mh: We are looking into AAS as well but I am not involved.

sk: I can give news on AAS. There is one SM that is reflecting the TD approach. It is called the Asset Interface Description. I am making sure that we reflect the TD approach so that existing implementations do not have to change too much.

mh: I have read your paper on this.

ek: Anything lacking in the standards?

mh: Not really. We have discussion on what the spec means.

ek: Do you have some recs for new implementations?

mh: I have started with a virtual thing. That I could do very well. Then you can follow the track and build up. Just try, get your hands "dirty"

ek: does the smartphone app use cloud connection or shopfloor.

mh: it is the shopfloor connection since we have a lot of data.

ek: Would you be interested in joining the standardization.

<!-- Hidden Questions we can ask: -->
<!-- What part of the standards was not clear enough or where did you struggle the most? -->
<!-- How was your development journey? What would you recommend to companies evaluating to implement WoT in their stack? -->
<!-- What do you find missing in the standards? -->
<!-- We find it amazing that you have done a full WoT implementation. Would you be interested in joining the standardization? -->
<!-- sharing TMs of your sensors if people want to use them in their system -->
<!-- Does the smartphone app use the cloud or shopfloor ocnnection? -->

### Discussion on TM-driven Workflows and Onboarding

ek: TM based Onboarding.

mh: We define the application based on the TM. We can then build small TMs and combine them.

ca: more the templating or composition?

mh: We are using more the composition. Our products do not use the placeholders afaik.

mh: We are not generating the TD from the TM. The TD is generated based on the information we have.

ca: Does it follow the spec?

mh: I am not sure, I need to check.

ph: How do you store TDs in the backend?

mh: we have a NoSQL db. It is now possible to configure one.

ph: can you query links? or give all TDs with type equals something

mh: no we cannot do it.

ek: So the client gets the TD then builds the graph?

mh: yes indeed.

ph: if you use a document store, you can at least do json path.

mh: we have a DB for TMs and that is a graph db.
