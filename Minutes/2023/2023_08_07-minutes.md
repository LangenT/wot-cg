### Tutorial Series

ek: we can talk about the tutorial series and then on the TPAC

ek: I have sent slides from the what is wot meetup, did you get them?

jf: yes it worked

ek: Our original idea was to revamp the lecture series on the web of things.

ek: but that was very long, so we had to change the format and where we make it public.

ek: the storyline is based on the what you need to know in general about the web of things.

ek: We should also talk about semantic technologies which we were not doing at all.

ek: Preliminaries and then go into the web of things.

ek: We are putting some guidelines on things like the colors and like how to do this kind of animations.

ek: in essence we sketch in a very quick PowerPoint.

ek: then we found this and voice over generator. You can basically give the text and like choose even emotions and so on. realistic and audio output, but that you can easily work with the text and like generate the the video and adjust the timing accordingly.

ek: that's sort of workflow and we are recently starting on a like a full website.

ek: So that the the tutorial content can be read at the same time so that it's not just the the videos you have to watch like by stopping what you're doing  and so on and so forth.

ek: you said you  have interest on semantic web parts or maybe some other things?

ek: I think we are also new on this kind of workflows and like since it's not like code reviews or it's not simple text files to work.

jf: But the the mode of operation is still over GitHub, right?

ek: Yes. So the the files will be all there, like all the PowerPoint files, text for the audio and final video.

ek: the website will be also on GitHub.

ek: We also talked with some people from W3C and it might be possible to push it to a W3C developer's page and which is generally more HTML, CSS kind of tutorials together with edX.

ek: you can certificate of attendance.

jf: so it is about showing trust of attendance?

ca: yes, I am sending a link.

ek: So for that we need to generate more content first to to show how it really looks like and something that can be certified because the single video or tutorial lighting at the moment would be too short.

jf: ok

jf: So and right now you have like what I saw on GitHub the the introduction right that does like the basic overview of what you can like do with it.

jf: And so is there anything else that you have already finished or are you still working on? Like making it deeper?

is: actually published first two videos in the GitHub if I'm not mistaken.

is: First one is introduction to this series. Basically like what you need to expect from the series.

is: Like what is web of things.

is: we have 12 right now.

is: So basically, for the first six one we explained JSON and JSON schema.

is: Both in practice and the as a concept, and then we moved to the OSI layers and then we explain general generic web of things.

is: I'm still working on the new videos.

is: So for the website, I hope to have a first version of how it will look like by tpac.

ek: So we can actually add more things to preliminary stuff like you mentioned and think of a way how we can like work together.

ek: So you can provide the script or do the points and so on like what a voice over should generate.

jf: How deep does it go. I guess the closest technology wise is kind of the JSON schema tutorial.

> ek: shows the slides

ek: And so like, it explains the concept like very basically and like the the simple types but I think we can also even go into like type generation like because we actually use it for an scripting API for type generation

ek: We need to talk about this combinations at the very end. There is the if then else on how we get a conditional validation.

jf: Do you do that for all the parts that for all the topics?

ek: So the overall goal is to keep the videos short, which has multiple reasons.

ek: One is so that people can watch small things.

ek: The other thing it's it makes easy to store it in GitHub since you don't need to then find like a Google Drive.

jf: ok right.

jf: So the the task then is to, I guess, create the PowerPoint of the flow is that I create the PowerPoints.

jf: I guess it's a script as well or.

ek: yes

ek: So currently the the script is written in the PowerPoint notes for us, but we can think of a different way, but in the end the script is.

> ek: shows voiceover tool

ek: So once we put a text in here and and then from every text again like it just the pronunciation or like how we can do the pauses and it will generate the voice so that you can like correctly overlay and time according to the video.

ek: Do you have topics you think you can contribute like semantic web?

jf: I guess some kind of introduction to JSON LD would probably be the start and then maybe see from there.

jf: Probably only with certain ontologies or with a very specific example.

jf: I thought maybe like first even like what is an ontology in the 1st place.

ek: If you were to have it in the JSON format, that's where JSON LD comes in.

ek: And then like the context, what is the context? And so on.

jf: The tutorials are meant to be like technical, right?

ek: Yes, some of them are a bit generic 

fs: The topic is so huge that I am, uh, we need to really think about how to do it.

fs: Uh, because it's because there are so many languages to describe ontologies, and JSON LD is just one of them.

fs: And then there are also like all these kind of things that you can have as well, like a schema for an ontology and so on.

jf: So I wouldn't really go into like the whole shapes stuff and maybe also not really go into owl itself and maybe just kind of say or use one ontology and say hey, this exists and not go into too much of the formal details.

fs: I like because it's really underrepresented right now.

jf: This the idea to introduce the the technology and then say how the thing description uses it.

fs: So and the first couple of videos don't actually talk a lot about web of things at all.

fs: So you really focus on the technology itself, which may be redundant, but you need to understand to get to know the thing description.

fs: So we said we would like this and for people that already know this

jf: ok
