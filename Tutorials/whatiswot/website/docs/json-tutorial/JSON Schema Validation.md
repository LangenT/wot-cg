In the previous tutorials of JSON Schema, we have shown the features and basic implementations of JSON Schema. 
In this tutorial, we will deliver the actual validation process with libraries and examples.



Throughout this tutorial, we will mainly focus on validation with the JavaScript library AJV (https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) and the Python library jsonschema(https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema) but there are many other libraries in different programming languages and tools to validate JSON Schema.

## Validator Examples

Here are some of the popular ones in different programming languages. 

There are many more validators. For further information, you can check the Json schema website (https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#validator-rust).
