# What is WoT

Let's discover **Web of Things** briefly.

## Difference Between IoT and WoT

Before we explain WoT, lets first talk about what is the difference between the WoT and IoT. While IoT focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, WoT leverages IoT and aims to provide interoperability between Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

## Thing Description

In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an IoT device or service. And TD (Thing Description) provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

## Web of Things in a Nutshell

WoT provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to streamline IoT application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm. With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases especially in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools. What can be achieved with the WoT is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and develop the WoT applications.

If you are ready to dive into world of WoT, letâ€™s start this journey!
