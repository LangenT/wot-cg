00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,293 
Hello! Welcome to the "What is WoT" video series.

2
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:19,867 
Throughout this video series, we will explain the Web of Things, its applications, and tools for newcomers.

3
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:26,145 
We structured this video series in two stages. First, introduce the concepts

4
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:32,422 
from basics to advanced. Then, support them with demos and applications.

5
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:37,226 
This is to learn Web of Things and speed up the learning process.

6
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:42,665 
Each video is short, so you can learn Web of Things bit by bit.

7
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:48,001 
At any time, you can come back and use the videos as a reference.

8
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:53,677 
This video series is not only consisting of material to watch but is also

9
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:59,352 
supported with code snippets that you can work on and try by yourself.

10
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:03,053 
At the end of the series, you will have all the

11
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:06,754 
tools in your belt to build Web of Things applications.

12
00:01:06,754 --> 00:01:12,680 
With all these tools, you can build actual software such as dashboards,

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,367 
protocol proxies,

14
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:19,884 
smart internet-connected devices,

15
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:24,547 
mash ups of Web of Things devices and services,

16
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:28,177 
in many domains such as Smart Homes,

17
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:30,852 
and Factory Automation

18
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:36,673 
Since you came across this video series, we assume that you heard a bit

19
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:42,495 
about the Web of Things and Thing Description. But let us give a brief introduction.

20
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:46,658 
Before we explain Web of Things, lets first talk about the

21
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:50,828 
difference between the Web of Things and Internet of Things.

22
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:59,926 
While Internet of Things focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, Web of Things leverages Internet of

23
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:09,024 
Things and aims to provide interoperability between Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

24
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,766 
So lets talk about a thing and thing description

25
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,240 
In the Web of Things Architecture, a Thing is defined as

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,429 
an abstraction of an Internet of Things device or service.

27
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:26,142 
And Thing Description provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

28
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:33,000 
Web of Things provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,859 
streamline Internet of Things application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm.

30
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:47,191 
With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases especially

31
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:54,523 
in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools.

32
00:02:54,651 --> 00:03:01,528 
What can be achieved with the Web of Things is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and

33
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:08,405 
develop the WoT applications If you are ready to dive into world of WoT, let's start this journey!

34
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:14,989 
In the next video, we will talk about Payloads and Headers. If you already know the

35
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,536 
basics, you can skip the introduction and directly move to general Web of Things videos.
