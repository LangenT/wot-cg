# Video Workflow

A typical "What is WoT?" tutorial video follows the steps below. The product of each step is reviewed before proceeding to the next.

1. A text file is created that will later be the voice-over text. This is the easiest to review over GitHub.
1. A simple slideset is created that has basic slides to explain the content. This is considered the script or the storyboard.
2. The storyboard is turned into an animation within the slideset with all the visual and spoken text elements present.
3. The animation is imported into the voiceover generation tool where the following is done:
   1. The text from each slide is imported
   2. The voiceover is generated
   3. Time synchronization happens manually. This can involve tweaks to the animation.
   4. Background music is added
4. The video is shared via a link to enable easy review without requiring to upload the video for each change requested.
5. The video is uploaded to GitHub with the following content:
  1. Video file
  2. VTT subtitle file
  3. Video description
  4. License Code for Background Music
  5. Thumbnail
7. Final review happens
8. A batch of videos is uploaded to YouTube
