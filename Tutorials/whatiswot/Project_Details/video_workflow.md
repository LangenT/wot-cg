# Video Workflow

A typical "What is WoT?" tutorial video follows the steps below. The product of each step is reviewed before proceeding to the next.

1. We start each video with a simple slideset that has basic slides to explain the content. This is considered the script or the storyboard.
2. The storyboard is turned into an animation within the slideset with all the visual and spoken text elements present.
3. The animation is imported into the voiceover generation tool where the following are done:
   1. The text from each slide is imported
   2. The voiceover is generated
   3. Time synchronization happens manually. This can involve tweaks to the animation.
   4. Background music is added
   5. Video is exported
4. The review happens for the final product
5. A batch of videos are uploaded to YouTube
