# Voiceover

## Text Rules

When the voiceover text is written, some general rules should be respected.

- Acronyms should be written in full for the first appearance in all videos;
- Capitalization should be respected since the text will be copied over as a reading material and the capitalization helps the speaker identifying words to be spoken as is, i.e. wot → WoT, td → TD.
- Subjective qualifiers should be avoided if possible. Examples are “a lot”, “huge” etc.
- Unspecific words like “things”, “like that”, “stuff” etc. should be avoided

## Subtitle Format

In the end, the subtitle text should be exported as <https://github.com/w3c/wot-marketing/blob/main/videos/WoT-Explainer-Video/WOTMotion.en.vtt>.
This is a standard that is commonly used. Murf.ai has this export option.
