00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700 
In this video, we will briefly explain Schema Languages and then move to the JSON Schema since it

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.400 
is the one that describes and validates JSON, it is important to know in Web of Things scope.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.675 
Let us explain what is a schema.

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:24.531 
Many payload formats offer a way to describe what a payload instance should look like.

00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:32.387 
Generally, these are called Schema Languages. For example, JSON Schema, XML Schema, PDF Schema.

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:35.875 
Now let's take JSON Schema.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:43.823 
JSON Schema is a JSON document used to describe and validate how JSON payload instance should look like.

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:50.003 
The main idea is to enable senders such as clients to understand how

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:56.182 
the request should be and for the receiver to automatically validate the payloads.

00:00:56.182 --> 00:01:02.331 
Although, it is a JSON on its own, it is metadata.

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:11.356 
For Example, some basic JSON Schemas, “type”: “array” tells it accepts type array in other JSON documents. This

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:20.381 
can be defined for other types in JSON as well, such as, string, number, boolean, and null.

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:26.256 
Thus, in the receiver end, you can do this validation process to validate.

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:32.131 
This is an example how it could look like in Java Script.

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:39.144 
It can look different in other programming languages. For instance: python,

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:41.944 
Java

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:50.606 
and C++

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:57.569 
Of course, way more advanced validations can be possible with JSON Schema such as:

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.519 
Regular expressions, URIs, length of a string

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:06.581 
Max/min for numbers, IP addresses, email addresses

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:11.694 
Or you can specify amount of the items and allowed types in an array,

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:16.531 
as well as required properties and amount of properties in an object.

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:21.081 
In the next video, we will talk about Basics of JSON Schema .
