00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.056 
In this video, we will briefly explain Schema Languages and then move to the JSON Schema since it

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:14.112 
is the one that describes and validates JSON, which is important in the scope of Web of Things.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:17.237 
Let us explain what is a schema.

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:25.055 
Many payload formats offer a way to describe what a payload instance should look like. Generally,

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:32.872 
these are called Schema Languages. For example, JSON Schema, XML Schema, GraphQL Schema Definition Language.

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:36.360 
Now let's take JSON Schema.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.309 
JSON Schema is a JSON document used to describe and validate how JSON payload instance should look like.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.435 
The main idea is to enable senders such as clients to understand how

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:56.562 
the request should be and for the receiver to automatically validate the payloads.

00:00:56.562 --> 00:01:03.950 
Although it is also a JSON, it is metadata and not part of the payloads.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:13.425 
We can see some basic JSON Schema examples here. “type”: “array” tells that the schema accepts JSON documents that are

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:22.900 
arrays. This can be defined for other types in JSON as well, such as, string, number, boolean, and null.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.762 
Thus, in the receiver end, you can do this validation process to

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:34.625 
validate. This is an example how it could look like in JavaScript.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:40.200 
It can look different in other programming languages. For instance:

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.512 
Python,

00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:45.312 
Java

00:01:45.312 --> 00:01:56.775 
and C++

00:01:56.775 --> 00:02:03.537 
Of course, way more advanced validations are possible with JSON Schema such as:

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:08.812 
Regular expressions, URIs, length of a string

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:14.550 
Max/min for numbers, IP addresses, email addresses

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.150 
Or you can specify amount of the items and allowed types in an array,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.337 
as well as required properties and amount of properties in an object.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:31.337 
In the next video, we will go into further details of JSON Schema.
