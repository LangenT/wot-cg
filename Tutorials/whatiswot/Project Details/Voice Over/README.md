Voiceover

Text Rules

When the voiceover text is written, some general rules should be respected.

- Acronyms should be written in full for the first appearance in all videos;
- Capitalisation should be respected since the text will be copied over as a reading material and the capitalisation helps the speaker identifying words to be spoken as is, i.e. wot → WoT, thing description → Thing Description.
- Subjective qualifiers should be avoided if possible. Examples are “a lot”, “huge” etc.
- Avoid using unspecific words like “things”, “like that”, “stuff” etc.

In the end, the subtitle text should be exported as https://github.com/w3c/wot-marketing/blob/main/videos/WoT-Explainer-Video/WOTMotion.en.vtt This is a standard that is commonly used. murf has this export option.
